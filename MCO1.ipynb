    "The data collection was conducted face-to-face within a total national sample of 42,768 sample households (rounds with Batanes sample) or 42,576 sample households (rounds without Batanes sample) per survey round (quarterly in a year). This specific data set was collected from April 8, 2016 until April 30, 2016. To ensure the data set had proportional representation among the samples, the PSA designed a master sample which ensures a randomly assigned and selected set of geographic areas with non-overlapping and discernable boundaries known as PSUs. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the data collection method utilized a randomized sampling approach, the data collected is well representative of the national and regional statistics. With their systematic survey execution, a high-response rate of 95.7% was achieved which minimizes nonresponse bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to the survey only including participants from private households and excluding people from the institutional population, the survey might potentially be underestimating labor force statistics and creating less accurate results."
